GitHub Repository for the Radio Telescope building project beig conducted under StarLab Research Team at NIT-Bhopal.

Welcome to the StarLAb Radio Telescope project repository! ðŸŒŒ

Our project aims to build a Radio Telescope capable of receiving and recording wavelenghts of the Ku Wavelenght Band (12 - 18 GHz).

The two primarry goals for the projects are :
1) To receive and process radio signals from satellites in earthâ€™s orbit and map all the man made satellites.
2) To receive and process radio signals from the Sun.

This customized radio telescope will use a microcontroller to configure its position automatically. We will use the Stellarium Web Skychart to predetermine the positions of satellites and progam the setup through the microcontroller to point towads the desired object. After setting its position, it will start receiving signals with a signal detector/satellite finder connected to a PC with dedicated SDR software (Software Defined Radio) for receiving/storing/processing radio signal. 

The mount will be using An AltAz Style movement system, where two motors will be used to vary the ALtiude and the Azimuth of the Antenna. The antenna will consist of a Aluminium Mesh Parabolic Dish with a Ku Band LNB mounted on its arm, which  will be connected to a Satellite Finder (for measurinig the magnitude of the relevant radiation) through coaxial cables.

Outcome: To gain practical skills in electronics, signal processing, data analysis, and scientific inquiry through building and operating the telescope.

We aim to complte this project and build a fully functioning Radio Telescope by the end of Odd Semester in 2024, i.e. by November 2024.
